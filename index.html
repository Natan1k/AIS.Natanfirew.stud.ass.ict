            Addis Ababa University and his DSc from Johns Hopkins University<br>
            in 1964 for his research on leishmaniasis. In 1964, he discovered<br>
            a cheap and natural treatment against bilharzia or schistosomiasis<br>
            , a disease which affects 200 million people globally. The <br>

            treatment was from the fruit of a common African plant, endod,which possesses molluscicidal activity.Lemma 
            returned to Ethiopia as faculty member at Addis Ababa University, and later founded the now named Aklilu Lemma 
            Institute of Pathobiology. He initiated the foundingof the Ethiopian Academy of Sciences, but this was impeded
            by the revolution and Derg Regime and would be picked up again in the early 2000s. In 1976, Lemma worked for  
            the United Nations and became the Deputy Director of UNICEF's International Child Development Centre and later 
            became a professor in the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins. He was awarded the Right Livelihood
            Award of Sweden in 1989.
